# Student-Intervention-System
In this project, our goal is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate

## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory boston_housing/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

`ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb`

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
