    "- KNN\n",
    "Real-world application: Predicting the compressive strength of various mixtures of cement ingredients. All of the ingredients were relatively non-volatile with respect to the response or each other. KNN made reliable predictions on it. If we have parametric regression for example which is defined by the function/parameters, then we would use those parameters to estimate the output. However, where KNN is good is non-parametric regression because we are using data to estimate the output. However, with only changing number of neighbors we can change the output a lot, so we need to be very careful when tuning n_neighbors parameter. The pros are fast training and easily adding more points, but the cons are slow querying and the fact that we need to store data. This model could be a good candidate because we dont have a lot of data, we have non-parametric classification, so the slow querying is not an issue for us, and with the proper parameter tuning we can get decent results.\n",

    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC)\n",
    "Real-world application: We can use neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The idea is to estimate the gradient by computing the part of the gradient for a small sample of randomly chosen training inputs. By averaging over this small sample it turns out that we can quickly get a good estimate of the true gradient, and this helps speed up gradient descent, and thus learning. Pros are that it is a fairly well studied algorithm, so for the most part the problems with GD have solutions. However, sometimes calculating the gradient can be very expensive or intractable if the size of our data is large. Stochastic gradient descent is a good option which theoretically will converge to a local max. Since we do not have lots of data in this problem, and with tuning parameters, this should be a good option for us.\n",

    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "Real-world application: Binary classification. They have the advantage that you can use them for non-linear decision boundaries. But the disadvantage is that you can't attribute meaning (e.g. why the features being X result in the sample being classified y). That is because the idea behind SVM is to find the greates margin between two different sets. It is computing it mathematically to find the hyperplane which will separate data with the greates margin. If the data is not linearly separable in 2D, it will hit up higher dimension and then try to separate it. It is heavily relied on vector and thus the name Support Vector Machines. SVM performs poorly with large datasets and with datasets with lots of noise. This is not the case in our problem, so I think that this is good option"

With tuning parameters, we can achieve even higher score. However, we can see that the training time of Support Vector Classifier is the highest, but since we do not have lots of data, that fact is not as important to us as the F1 testing score. The best model for this problem is SVC."

If the data is not linearly separable in a certain dimension, SVC is capable of raising the dimension and trying to find the hyperplane which will linearly separate the data. It is great for binary classification, and our problem is binary classification because we need to decide if someone is either pass the year or not. "
